# stings are just like variables byt you don't need to cut the code
# to set one you'll do the same with the variables, example
name = "Jhon Doe"
age = 50
# now printing is the same
name = "Jhon Doe"
age = 50
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# this lesson is shorter than i thougt
